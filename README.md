# Webpack base 

This is a base project for start your own, based on ES6 and Webpack 4


## Project purpose

Actually exists thousand of tutorials, and most of then are deprecated using old versions of technologies like Webpack 1.x.

For someone who wants to start to build application, this is a frustrating task. This is the right project for start your builds.


## Installation

1. simply clone / download the project
2. install dependencies `npm install`
3. Start to write code

Simple right?

## Usage

After code something, you can run next commands in your terminal:

* `npm run build` - pack all on `dist/` open with your favorite browser.
* `npm run build-prod` - pack all minified.
* `npm run develop` - like build but await for changes to re build.
* `npm run star` - like build with integrated server `http://localhost:8080` by default for see your project.

## Recipes

Actuallty exist only one for ES6, we will update with extras like Vue, React, SASS, static assets, etc.

All recipes will be stored on separate branch, so wait for it.
